# Features
* Everything you type is saved on the fly - you don't have to remember to click any save button
* You can change the background color, border color, font color, font size, and font family
* You can move the note around and change its size
* The note doesn't show as an open application, so it is not visible in the taskbar
* The note is visible only on the desktop - it will be always below any other open application
* You can uncomment this line: `autostart = Autostart()`, and the application will add itself to the autostart folder and launch automatically on startup
